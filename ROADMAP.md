# Roadmap

## Misc

- progress bar for upload: get notified by file stream in form-data, use total file size as reference
- put proper validation from Scroll Viewport in `envTemplate`
- TODO: TEST EVERYTHING, INCLUDING ENV VARIABLES

## ESNext

- With ESNext make getters private
- Use async functions already in constructor to compute doesThemeExist and themeId
